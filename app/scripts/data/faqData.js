**What do I get with a Formula Stocks subscription?**

  With a Formula Stocks subscription you get access to a secure dashboard (login area accessible via our website). Here you can follow the development in our portfolio of carefully selected stocks, and on a weekly or monthly basis, according to your wishes, we provide new stock purchase and sale recommendations (and additional information about the given stocks), which you may choose to use to buy/sell stocks via your own broker/bank.

**How do I begin to invest?**

  It depends on how you wish to use Formula Stocks. There are four different ways.

  1.  Mirror the model portfolio, and update your stock portfolio once a month accordingly.
  2.  Use Formula Stocks recommendations when they appear and use them for new positions in your portfolio.
  3.  A combination. You can choose to apply a percentage, for instance 40%, to the model portfolio now, earmarking 20% for the first 3 months’ new recommendations, and keeping 40% in cash for later. This approach is a belt-and-braces way of easing slowly into a position over time.
  4.  Lastly, you can make your own analysis of either portfolio positions or recommendations, which, if you are a quite experienced investor, may be a very interesting alternative. You then use Formula Stocks effectively as a high-quality generator of vetted investment ideas, or a specialized stock screener.

**How often are new stocks recommended for purchase or sale?**

  New recommendations appear on a weekly basis. Accessing these once a month is sufficient for most investors. The number of weekly recommendations depends on market conditions. Formula Stocks looks for great opportunities in the markets; sometimes we locate only few, sometimes we locate many.

**How many new investment candidates are available?**

  The availability of new investment candidates is a function of the available investments we can locate in the markets with a sufficient degree of certainty. We buy stocks like you buy steaks in the supermarket. We generally prefer high quality and low prices. The market does not always accommodate our preferences, and the number of candidates does vary greatly with the price level of the general market. If pickings are slim, we may prefer a partial cash position for a while.

**How often do I need to think about my portfolio?**

  You need to check for recommendations or alternatively rebalance your portfolio once a month. At least, if you want your portfolio to match the Formula Stocks portfolio exactly. This is not a requirement, though. A loosely managed portfolio or simply single, handpicked investments can perform just as well. We recommend a monthly checkup. If your personality is more in tune with frequent attention to investments, our purchase recommendations are updated on a weekly basis. Our strategies trade once a month. (This is to allow one full month for accumulation or distribution of larger positions).

**Do I enter my other portfolio positions in the app/website?**

  No. Formula Stocks is not aware of your actual positions. Formula Stocks displays an optimized model portfolio per plan and tracks its performance over time.

**What does a Formula Stocks purchase recommendation include?**

  Purchase recommendations are vetted from a quantitative, value, growth, and business analytics standpoint. More than 400 primary data points are considered by our Business Analytics software. When you receive a recommendation, you can access 10 data points with indications of price and growth characteristics. We do not write reports, as these tend to be influenced by human bias, and we are preferential to hard quantitative fact.

**How does Formula Stocks compare to passive index-investing?**

  Extremely favorably. Passive investment strategies, or index-investing, is simply investing in more or less all stocks available (or a subset of these). The outcome can only be average by definition. Since it is a given, that out of 5.000 stocks, 1 is the best, and 1 is the worst, and all of the other fall somewhere in between, and since it is possible for us to quantify to a reasonable extent, which is in either end of this spectrum, a priori, it is a deeply flawed strategy to simply invest in all stocks. Surely, it makes sense to invest more intelligently, allocating capital towards good businesses and avoiding bad businesses. A superficial argument can be made for passive investment on the basis of not requiring resources or thinking hence low fees, and for scaling well. But for informed participants, this argument is negated completely by the performance attainable by an active strategy such as Formula Stocks which equally operates with a low fee structure. It makes no sense to aim simply an average return, when it is possible to achieve an above-average return, net of fees.

**Which and how many stocks are covered by your service?**

  We do not supply a full list of all the potential stocks analyzed by our systems. It covers many thousands of stocks, however, ranging from micro-cap to mega-cap companies in all sectors with varying geography.

**How much can I expect in investment returns?**

  Formula Stocks can, like everyone else, not answer this question. We can optimize the odds for you to outperform the market averages. Historically, we have tended to outperform the market averages in both bear and bull markets. What we do is to improve the odds quite significantly. We do not control the outcome. The longer one is invested with Formula Stocks, however, the better the odds of success, as the outcomes converge more and more with the positively skewed odds over time.

**What about volatility?**

  Formula Stocks selections typically have smaller drawdowns over time than the S&P 500 and higher net returns. But due to smaller portfolio sizes and more concentration, the results are also likely to be more volatile in the shorter term. Refer to the Omega risk/reward benchmark found elsewhere on our website for more detail.

**Can I expect a quick return on my investment?**

  Generally no. It does happen that recommendations go straight up. But most of the time they do not. The creation of business value takes time, measured in quarters or years. Formula Stocks does not speculate on timing-related issues. We buy real businesses when it makes good sense to buy them, and we hold them until sufficient value has been created in the business or a better opportunity reveals itself. We may occasionally be early, and we may occasionally not buy at the very bottom; thus, one may well experience an initial waiting period before a positive return emerges. Either way, patience and the ability to stick to the plan, enduring some volatility at times, are significant elements of achieving long-term success in any form of investing. This is well known to long-term value investors: Short-term volatility may precede long-term gain. Please refer to our online video visualization of returns over time.

**What risks do I incur when investing with Formula Stocks?**

  It is difficult to give a precise answer to this question. Generally, one incurs the risk of investing in stocks in a general sense. However, this risk is somewhat reduced, based upon the fact that Formula Stocks recommendations have much better than average odds of success and a reasonable margin of safety. At the same time, our portfolios are more concentrated than, say, the S&P 500. Consequently, our portfolios are likely to be more volatile. However, we do not consider volatility as risk, in a strict sense, although some investors do. (We have yet to meet an investor who frowns upon volatility to the upside when experiencing outsized gains). Please refer to the Omega graph found on our website for a comparison of risk/reward relative to the general market. Any investment involves risk. See our Terms and Conditions.

**What can I save using Formula Stocks instead of other products?**

  Formula Stocks offers a low, flat, and transparent fee, which does not scale with volume. What you can save depends on what you pay in fees elsewhere. This can be complicated to calculate, as many funds have a number of different costs, some of which can be grouped into sales charges, expense ratios, transaction commissions, and redemption fees. Hedge funds and alternative investment vehicles often include a large performance fee as well. Formula Stocks is usually the less expensive method, sometimes by a very large factor. It depends on the amount of capital deployed. From a saver’s perspective, the Formula Stocks model can be seen as an IKEA-like model. You buy inexpensive prefabricated parts (strategy and technology), do the final assembly yourself (purchase and sale of equities), and obtain very significant savings.

**Do you offer an investment fund/ETF with which one can invest directly?**

  No, not at this point in time.

**How do I pay for membership?**

  Usually with a credit card, although other options exist for BUSINESS and FUND members.

**Is there a trial period available?**

  We offer a free trial for a one-month period with full access to our BASIC plan.

**Is there a minimum period of subscription?**

  No. BASIC and PREMIUM are monthly subscriptions, whereas BUSINESS and FUND are yearly subscriptions. Once a period begins, it is non-refundable. You can cancel your subscription any time before a new period starts.

**Do I have to choose the portfolio suggested by Formula Stocks, or can I continue with my current portfolio?**

  This is entirely up to you. You can freely mix and match with any other portfolio, stock, or product.

**Can your products be used in any country?**

  Yes, absolutely. We cater to an international audience, and the stocks we prefer are available for purchase in all countries.

**Is your stock selection USA only?**

  Not at all. Formula Stocks analyzes most public US companies, a significant part of Canadian companies, and many larger international companies with an ADR (American Depositary Receipt). These are international companies which trade on the US exchanges, as if they were US stocks, even though the company itself may be located in any country in the world. These stocks can be traded very effectively from anywhere in the world, no matter where you a located geographically.

**What about currencies?**

  We use USD as a base currency for the sake of simplicity. No matter what your local currency is, you can easily use Formula Stocks anywhere in the world.

**Does Formula Stocks offer direct brokerage services or investment advisory services?**

  No.

**How does the Formula Stocks portfolios tie in with my existing asset allocation?**

  Formula Stocks offer sound diversification both in terms of stocks, sectors, and strategies. As you have full access to the Formula Stocks portfolio, you can judge the exact portfolio composition for yourself. Adding high-probability investment ideas should be a plus for any portfolio. You can either simply run your portfolio as a 1:1 mirror of our model portfolio, or freely mix and match specific investments with your pre-existing selections, in order to match your preferred asset allocation model.

**Does Formula Stocks short stocks?**

  No.

**Relatively few active investment managers beat the market averages. What makes Formula Stocks different?**

  We offer something that most investors do not have access to. Our proprietary IIT™ quantifies the risks and reward, odds of success, and the presumed future alpha of every investment candidate. It quantifies over 400 data points about every single business that we analyze. From this we are able to extract knowledge to typically beat the market averages using the scientific method. This proprietary technology, 14 years in the making, is a machine learning-based expert system, which runs on a supercomputer and possesses knowledge that is not generally available. Machine learning refers to a method of learning from the consequences of ones actions to improve future decisionmaking. Historically this has lead us to surpass the market returns (S&P 500) 88% of the time on a yearly basis (backtested 1970-2009, actual returns 2009-2016).

**Why are there fewer current portfolio positions than indicated as average?**

  The average number of concurrent portfolio positions over time are for Fund: 163, Business: 50, Premium: 96, Basic: 177. However, unlike an index fund Formula Stocks does not invest in stocks regardless of conditions. We only invest, when we see attractive probabilities for success. This means that the cheaper the markets get, of course the more diverse the portfolio becomes. Conversely, when the markets are expensive, fewer good investments can be located, and portfolio sizes decrease. Toward a price peak the number of positions may dwindle, as they are sold (for a profit), converted into cash, preparing for the next market cycle, when an inevitable correction materializes, and the portfolio once again expands.

**What does “cash allocation” percentages in purchase recommendations signify?**

  If you choose to mirror our model portfolio, you deploy a percentage of the available cash into a new stock each month. This is not a percentage of the entire portfolio’s net worth, but only of freely available cash.

**How is the model portfolio updated?**

  We recalibrate our model portfolio once a month. This involves purchasing new positions, selling existing positions, and adjusting position sizes. Once the decisions have been made, we allow for one full month to perform the actual trading required; this month is our "trading window" to allow slow accumulation or distribution of larger positions, without affecting price much. By using a longer time period, the price impact can be minimized. The recommendations are slightly different, as these are updated weekly, and change in content more frequently. A recommendation may appear some time before it is included in the model portfolio.

**What are the size limits/AUM limits?**

  Memberships BASIC and PREMIUM are designed for retail, with which relatively low individual AUMs are intrinsically expected. BUSINESS is designed for medium size capital, typically a corporation, CEO, CFO, accredited or sophisticated investor, etc., and institutional capital is specifically not allowed. FUND is designed for institutional capital, capable of very large AUMs. It is important not to attempt to use retail or BUSINESS memberships with institutional size capital. The required liquidity is available only in the FUND model, with sufficient diversification to satisfy institutional requirements.

**What about institutional capital?**

  Only our FUND membership is designed to handle institutional capital. It should cope with AUM sizes well beyond the largest fund AUMs. FUND is designed to maintain an adequate diversification level, with significant liquidity available for market operations, which can satisfy institutional requirements, including the ability to accumulate or distribute positions without affecting a large market impact. Contact us for further information.

**ow can you state results from 1970, when Formula Stocks development first began in 2003?**

  Our methods are fully quantifiable and built upon a timeless investment philosophy. This means that Formula Stocks methods will work on any opportunity set (any set of available stocks at any point in history, both past and future), and that the exact results of the past can be quantified with great accuracy. Our input is the market opportunity set regardless of time or macro. Our formula is our complex expert system based on sound business logic. The output is a set of fully quantifiable business decisions. Tracking the financial results of executing these decisions later on is both easy and reasonably accurate. While pre-2009 results are backtested, results stated post our initial launch in 2009 match our actual real life experience and expectation.

**Do you recommend stocks with which you have any form of affiliation or interest?**

  Absolutely not. Formula Stocks operates under very strict ethical standards. We will never recommend anything in which we have a vested interest. We receive no compensation from any parties. Formula Stocks employees are allowed to invest using the products for personal retirement purposes, alongside members through the website.
