          <p>
            When you register an account on our website or application, as part of the process,
            we collect the personal information you give us such as your name, country and email address.
            <br/><br/>
            When you browse our website or application, we also automatically receive your computer’s
            internet protocol (IP) address in order to provide us with information that helps us learn
            about your browser and operating system.<br/><br/>

            Email marketing (if applicable): With your permission, we may send you emails about our
            website or application, new products and other updates.<br/><br/>
          </p>

          <h3>Consent</h3>
          <p>
          When you provide us with personal information, when you register an account, complete a
          transaction, verify your credit card, place an order, arrange for a delivery or return a
          purchase or give us your information in any other way, we imply that you consent to our
          collecting it and using it for that specific reason only.<br/><br/>

          If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, like marketing,
          we will either ask you directly for your expressed consent, or provide you with an
          opportunity to say no.
          </p>

          <h3>Disclosure</h3>
          <p>
          We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to do so or if you
          violate our Terms of Service.
          </p>

          <h3>Payment</h3>
          <p>
          If you choose a direct payment gateway to complete your purchase, then FORMULA STOCKS stores
          your credit card data. It is encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard
          (PCI-DSS). Your purchase transaction data is stored only as long as is necessary to complete your
          purchase transaction. After that is complete, your purchase transaction information is deleted.
          <br/><br/>
          All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security
          Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and
          Discover.
          <br/><br/>
          PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our website
          and its service providers.
          </p>

          <h3>Third-party services</h3>
          <p>
          In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your
          information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.
          <br/><br/>
          However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment
          transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are
          required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.
          <br/><br/>
          For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand
          the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these providers.
          <br/><br/>
          In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are
          located a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a
          transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your information
          may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its
          facilities are located.
          <br/><br/>
          As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment
          gateway located in the United States, then your personal information used in completing that
          transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States legislation, including the Patriot
          Act.
          <br/><br/>
          Once you leave our website or application or are redirected to a third-party website or
          application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our website’s Terms of Service.
