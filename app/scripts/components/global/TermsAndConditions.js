          <h3>General</h3>

          <p>
          FORMULA STOCKS is an information provider, not an investment advisory service,
          nor a registered investment advisor and does not offer individual investment advice.
          FORMULA STOCKS does not manage client funds, but act solely as an information and technology
          supplier. FORMULA STOCKS does not purport to tell or suggest which securities individual
          customers should buy or sell for themselves. FORMULA STOCKS purchase or sell indications,
          are not solicitations to buy or sell, but rather, information you can use as a starting point
          for doing additional independent research in order to allow you to form your own opinion
          regarding investments, and make your own informed decisions.<br/><br/>

          FORMULA STOCKS assume no responsibility or liability for your investment results.
          You understand and acknowledge that there is a high degree of risk involved in investing in
          securities. This document and service does not constitute an offer, a solicitation to buy a
          security or to open a brokerage account. The terms and conditions of the products described
          herein are indicative and are subject to change.<br/><br/>

          The supplied information is provided solely for educational and informational purposes and may
          not be construed as an offer to buy or sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell,
          any financial instrument or to engage in any specific strategy or as an official confirmation
          of terms.<br/><br/>

          It should not be assumed that the systems presented in these products will be profitable or
          that they will not result in losses. Past results of any investment system published by
          Formula Stocks are not necessarily indicative of future returns. In addition, information,
          system output, articles and other features of our products are provided for educational and
          informational purposes only and should not be construed as investment advice. Accordingly,
          you should not rely solely on this information in making any investment. You should check with
          your licensed financial advisor and tax advisor to determine the suitability of any investment,
          and/or read relevant prospectuses, while taking into account your own financial situation
          and objectives.FORMULA STOCKS plans vary in terms of diversification, and may or may not be
          adequately diversified for any particular risk profile as the required level of diversification
          differs from individual to individual. Set your own individual maximum position size
          accordingly or consult an advisor.<br/><br/>

          The real time test period 2009-2011 reflects actual investment results. Other period statistics
          are the result of backtesting the strategies. Backtested performance results have certain
          inherent limitations, as they could potentially be designed with some benefit of hindsight,
          even though best efforts has been taken to avoid such risk. Unlike an actual performance record
          (such as the 2009-2011 record), backtested results do not represent actual trading
          and may not be impacted by brokerage and other slippage fees. Also, since transactions
          may or may not actually have been executed, results may have under- or over-compensated for
          impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of market liquidity or level of
          participation. FORMULA STOCKS business analytics depend on the accuracy of the published
          accounts of public corporations. Such accuracy may from time to time be less than ideal.
          FORMULA STOCKS strategies evolve and improve on a recurring basis, and any result and statistic
          is therefore subject to change without notice. FORMULA STOCKS employees may or may not own
          equities mentioned in the service. NO REPRESENTATION IS BEING MADE THAT YOU ARE LIKELY TO
          ACHIEVE PROFITS OR LOSSES SIMILAR TO THOSE SHOWN.<br/><br/>

          For users of our “BUSINESS” plan service only (does not apply to “BASIC” or “PREMIUM” plan
            members): The BUSINESS service is intended for what is generally known as accredited or
            sophisticated investors, or corporations/businesses. The exact definition of accredited and
            sophisticated varies between countries, generally referring to either a certain net worth,
            income, or professional status, status as a corporation or financial institution or
            business with relation to the investment field. In the US it could imply either a net worth
            in excess of 1 mio. USD, excluding value of primary residence, or alternatively an annual income
            of at least 200,000 USD, or other factors as defined in regulations, such as status as an
            investment company, bank, insurance company, charitable organization with a certain amount of
            assets, and many other designations. Using BUSINESS does require some knowledge about investments
            in general, due to its focused nature, and if you sign up to the BUSINESS plan,
            you indicate that you can be considered either A) a sophisticated or accredited investor based
            upon either the rules of definition in your country of residence, or
            B) Represent a corporation/business which by definition enlists the services of tax or
            financial advisors, or C) by your own definition meet similar standards of investment
            knowledge where this may be applicable.<br/><br/>

          Keep in mind that while diversification may help spread risk it does not assure a profit,
          or protect against loss. There is always the potential of losing money when you invest in
          securities, or other financial products. Investors should consider their investment objectives
          and risks carefully in the context of their own personal financial situation before investing.<br/><br/>
